Having absolutely zero programming background, I needed the step-by-step explanations given in the discussion thread “A Study in JavaScript: Provided Code for the Game Clone,” written by Udayan. The post explained the engine and resources JS files very well.

However, I just couldn't figure out app.js on my own. So I copied from students who had posted their project repositories on GitHub and shared the links in the forum. Many thanks to danielmoi, morapost, andrewlw89, jyothisridhar, ayimaster, lacyjpr and joseterrera.

Once I meet the code reviewers' expectations for this project, I will pay it forward by sharing my work too, in case someone can learn from it.
